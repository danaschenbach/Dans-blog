## Welcome to Dan's Blog.

### You will first need to do a couple of things to get up and running:
* 1st: Download all files contained in Dan's Blog
* 2nd: Locate where you saved the files and copy the address
* 3rd: Open your command prompt and type in 'cd' + the address of files
* 4th: Type in 'dev_appserver.py .'( notice the space between py & . )
* 5th: Enjoy the fruits of my labor...lol

This was NOT the easiest project to complete, and I couldn't of done it without the help of the wounderful people at stackoverflow.com.
